#How to deal with dangling characters? ideas:
	#if there are dangling characters
	#if words.join.length < str.length

#ORIGINAL CONCEPT

#{}"catrun" 
#1. create a hash to store words
#3. loop over the first character and check if it's a word according to dictionary.rb
#4. if you check it and it's not a word, add the next character to the current one, then redo check-if-word, until you find a word
#5. when you find a group of characters that is a word, store said group in the array, then 
#6. start with the next character and check if that's a word, if not add the next character and check again, repeat
#7. if you haven't found another word despite looping over the remaining characters, go back to the beginning and start over
#8. this time, don't stop after you find the first word. wait until you find the second word, then store it in the array over the original first word,
#9. start with the next character and check if that's a word, if not add the next character and check again, repeat
#10.if you haven't found another word despite looping over the remaining characters, go back to the beginning of the second word and do step 8 again
#11.when you've iterated through all the characters and they are each in a word that is stored in the array, return that array
