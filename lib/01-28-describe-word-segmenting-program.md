Describing my word segmenting program.

1. How does it work?
2. Go line-by-line or block-by-block to give clarity.
3. Add lines of code into this journal entry so I can describe them specifically. Add only a few lines at a time.
4. The goal is clarity... Must be able to talk through the code so that other people can understand.
